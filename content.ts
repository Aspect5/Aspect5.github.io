  greeting: "My Dearest K,",
  body: [
    "It is time I got my revenge for you making me cry in the back of an Uber while reading your beautiful farewell.",
    "Normally I'd respond with an evil missive in my designated love-letter handwriting and send it off with my best attempt at a wax seal and a kiss for good luck.",
    "But there are a couple issues with that. The first one is that I frankly don't know what country I'll be in tomorrow, let alone where to find a card shop or how to mail it.",
    "The second one is that I'm writing because of something I saw, which you can see and hear on the left side of this card (provided that all my code works out).",
    "As I was devastated to realize in the fifth grade after printing out an animation I spent hours making, motion does not translate well to paper. (Yes, I can be quite silly at times, I'm sure you've noticed).",
    "Since then I've learned my lesson (and also gotten better at coding). So, I decided that I'd go full sweat and make a voxel-based physics simulation of a 3D card and embed a video onto it.",

    "<i>Oh the silly things we do in the name of <s>love</s> passion...</i>",
    
    "Anyways, I lied in the fourth paragraph. I'm not actually writing because of something I saw. I'm writing because of something I <i>felt</i>.",
    "Before I met you, I would have watched the show on the left and enjoyed it for the performance of Johann Strauss and the story conveyed by the dancers' movements.",
    "I would have given a round of applause, smiled, and moved on with my day.",
    "But now, I watch it knowing what it feels like to hold someone in my arms and dip them, to spin them around while ensuring they don't fall.",
    "And K, I can't lie... <br>",
    "in that moment...<br>",
    "<br><i>there was nothing in the world I wanted more than to hold you in my arms</i>", 
    "<br><i>to dip you like you taught me</i>",
    "<br><i>and to feel the press of your lips against mine.</i><br>",
    "Perhaps we can make that a reality someday...<br>",

    "<br><i>...until next time :)</i>"
